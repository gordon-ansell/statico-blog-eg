Static blogging is undoubtedly more technical than using something like Wordpress. It *can* be used successfully with very little tech knowledge, though. You just have to be prepared to learn a few things and maybe do things differently than you're used to (if you've used Wordpress, for example).

There is no doubt Wordpress is easier for the uninitiated, but static blogging affords more control and faster websites.

Think carefully before delving in to the world of Static Site Generators (SSGs). If you have time and a willingness to learn, I'd recommend it though.
