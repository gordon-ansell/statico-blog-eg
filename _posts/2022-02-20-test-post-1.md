This is an example first post, written in *Markdown* of course.

If you look at the source for this post you'll see the front matter between the ```---``` marks at the top. In most circumstances you need a *title* and a *date*, but the others are optional and can be defined as you choose. In this particular example set-up, it's configured to use *excerpt* as the brief summary used in post lists, *description*, which is used as the meta description in the HTML ```<head>```, and *tags*, which help indicate a post's content.
